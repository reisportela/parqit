# Changelog

All notable changes to `parqit` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project adheres to
semantic versioning once `v0.1.0` is tagged.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.7] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **`parqit save` refuses strings with invalid UTF-8 instead of corrupting the
  file.** A Stata string carrying raw Latin-1/legacy bytes (e.g. `é` = `0xE9`,
  common in imported or admin data) used to be written verbatim into a
  UTF-8-typed Parquet column: the Arrow-scan writer produced a file no reader —
  parqit included — could decode (`parqit collect` → "not valid UTF8"), and the
  staged (`PARQIT_SAVE_NOARROW`) writer silently nulled the cell, with `rc 0` and
  no warning in both cases. Both writers now validate UTF-8 per cell and fail
  **loudly** at the offending `var[obs]` (pointing to `unicode translate`),
  never `rc 0` with a broken/stale file, and a failed save never clobbers a
  pre-existing good file. Valid UTF-8 (ASCII/accented/emoji/strL) is unaffected.
  This restores the "byte-identical under both paths" guarantee for v0.1.6.
  Verify test `v32_invalid_utf8_save`; see ASSUMPTIONS #49.
- **`parqit query` validates on a copy of the current view.** An invalid raw SQL
  fragment now returns a real error while leaving the previous lazy pipeline
  open and unchanged; it no longer discards the view during failed validation.
- **`string()`/`strofreal()` follow Stata's default `%9.0g` more closely.**
  Boundary cases that used to drift from Stata (`1e100`, `-1e100`,
  `.00009999999`, `.000123456`, and nearby scientific/decimal cutoffs) now go
  through an internal DuckDB scalar checked against native Stata output.
- **`substr()` is byte-indexed without blanking invalid UTF-8 slices.** Valid
  byte slices are exact Stata-style slices. If the requested bytes split a
  UTF-8 codepoint, parqit returns U+FFFD because DuckDB/Arrow VARCHAR values must
  remain valid UTF-8.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Much faster general `parqit save …, data` (modified in-memory data).** The
  writer now assembles each column once as an Arrow array and COPYs straight
  from a registered Arrow scan, instead of staging every value through a DuckDB
  temp table. On 10M rows this moves the mixed 13-column save from ~6.6s to
  ~4.9s (now faster than `pq`'s ~5.0s), numeric-only from ~2.7s to ~1.7s, and
  string-only from ~4.5s to ~3.2s — every case faster than before, none slower.
  Output is byte-identical (same conversions, verified by an independent pyarrow
  oracle and the full verify suite under both paths). The previous temp-table
  writer remains as a fallback, selectable with `PARQIT_SAVE_NOARROW=1`. Uses
  DuckDB's `duckdb_arrow_array_scan` (deprecated upstream but present in the
  pinned 1.5.x; pinned by an engine-capability test). See ASSUMPTIONS #48.
- **Faster `parqit save …, data` after an unchanged `parqit use …, clear`.**
  When the in-memory dataset is still the exact, unmodified result of loading a
  single regular Parquet file, `parqit save …, data` now writes by running DuckDB
  directly from that source file with the current Stata manifest and `parqit.*`
  metadata, instead of reading every cell back through the Stata Plugin
  Interface. The fast path is intentionally narrow: it is disabled after data
  changes, if the source file fingerprint changed, for sanitised/pathological
  source names, and for unsupported temporal formats (`%tc` stays on the general
  path). The old writer remains the fallback. On the 10M×13 synthetic benchmark,
  the `SAVE` leg moved from **6.852s** to **1.079s** while the pq leg in the same
  rerun was **5.342s**; `USE`, `DESCRIBE`, `MERGE`, merge→save, and `APPEND`
  remained in the same timing band, with value equality still reported by the
  benchmark.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **The view-save paths now emit the same lossy-conversion notes as the
  in-memory save** (ATOM-2, from `PARQIT_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT_FOR_CODEX_20260614.md`).
  A `parqit save` through a lazy view, and `parqit open _data`, performed the same
  lossy conversions the in-memory `save_data` path warns about (extended
  missings `.a`–`.z` → null, non-integer date/period values rounded) but printed
  **no note** — so a user could lose `.a`–`.z` identity or fractional-date
  precision silently through the product's headline workflow. Now:
  - **`parqit open _data`** surfaces the bridge snapshot's extended-missing and
    fractional-date notes that `qui` used to swallow (the loss happens when the
    in-memory dataset is written to the promotion bridge).
  - **`parqit save` through a view** detects a non-integer `%td`/`%tc`/`%tC`/period
    value that `compile_for_save`'s `round()` would change (e.g. a date column
    made fractional by `parqit replace`) and emits the same "rounded to the nearest
    unit" note. It does **not** invent an extended-missing note — a view over a
    Parquet source carries no Stata extended missings (those pass through
    verbatim) — and it does **not** double-warn for a loss already reported at
    `parqit open _data`.
  - The frac detection adds **no work to the common path**: a save with no date
    columns does nothing, and a date-bearing save runs only a metadata-only
    `LIMIT 0` describe — the one aggregate scan fires solely when a date column
    is genuinely floating-typed (A/B benchmark on a 5M-row date file: within
    run-to-run noise). The on-disk payload is byte-identical to the in-memory
    save and unchanged from before.
  - Locked in by `tests/verify_suite/v29_atom2_view_notes.do` (open-`_data` notes,
    `view == memory` payload, view-path frac note with no spurious ext note, and
    a clean integer-date save staying silent), each on-disk check via an
    independent pyarrow oracle.
- **Characteristics and notes survive a renamed column** (META-2): `parqit rename`
  now follows a column's characteristics (and notes, which are characteristics)
  to the new name, so they are no longer dropped when a renamed foreign column is
  saved through a view. Value labels already rode on the column and were unaffected.
- **`parqit save … , replace partition_by(...)` is re-runnable** (IO-3): a
  partitioned save with `replace` now removes an existing partition-*tree*
  directory (only after the new tree is staged and verified, never losing data
  on failure) and then renames atomically; a target that exists as a plain file,
  or `replace` omitted, is still refused loudly. (ATOM-1's atomicity was already
  in place — the partitioned branch stages in `dest.parqit_tmp`, verifies, then
  atomically renames.) Locked in by `tests/verify_suite/v30_residual_fixes_20260614.do`
  (re-run yields no stale/duplicated rows; pyarrow oracle).
- **An aborted collect no longer orphans its spill temp table** (ATOM-3):
  `set_prepared_read` drops a prior un-fetched `_parqit_collect_*` temp table before
  preparing the next, so a collect that aborts between prepare and fetch cannot
  accumulate spill tables for the session's life. The happy path (the fetch drops
  its own table) is unaffected (`DROP … IF EXISTS` is idempotent).

### Known limitations
- **All-null typed column** (META-3, assessed, not changed): an entirely-null
  *typed* Parquet column loads as an all-missing `byte` with no note. The values
  are correct (all missing); only the type metadata is downgraded. A faithful
  note needs the row count (to avoid spurious notes on 0-row files), which is
  computed after the sizing block, so a correct fix would thread state through the
  performance-critical F2 footer-sizing path for an informational note on a rare
  case — deferred as poor cost/benefit under the no-regression mandate.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
Second-round fixes from the 2026-06-14 multi-agent adversarial audit (see
`PARQIT_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT_2026-06-14_f386b5b.md`). All are Stata-faithful, verified
against real Stata 19.5 + an independent pyarrow oracle, and locked in by
`tests/verify_suite/v28_audit_fixes_20260614.do` plus new C++ unit assertions;
the full suite (C++ + 36 Stata verdicts) stays green.

- **`gen`/`replace` no longer leak `inf`/`nan` to disk** (NUM-1): `x/0` and
  non-real powers like `(-8)^0.5` are missing in Stata. The translator now guards
  `/` and `^` (`CASE WHEN isfinite(...) THEN ... ELSE NULL END`), so `parqit collect`
  and `parqit save` agree and a third party never reads `inf`/`nan` from a parqit file.
- **`round()` ties round toward +∞, not away from zero** (NUM-2): `round(x)` is
  `floor(x+0.5)` and `round(x,u)` is `floor(x/u+0.5)*u`, so `round(-2.5)==-2` and
  `round(-0.5)==0`, matching Stata (DuckDB's `round()` rounded ties away from zero).
- **`upper()`/`lower()` are ASCII-only; `ustrupper()`/`ustrlower()` are Unicode**
  (STR-1): `upper("café")=="CAFé"` again (a byte-safe ASCII fold via `translate`),
  while the `ustr*` family keeps DuckDB's Unicode case mapping.
- **An invalid `mdy()`/`dofm()` is row-local missing, never a query abort**
  (DATE-1): `make_date` is wrapped in `try()`, so one bad date triple no longer
  kills the whole `collect`/`save`.
- **`merge` uniqueness guard folds `""`/`NaN` to Stata-missing like the join**
  (MERGE-1): `check_unique` now applies the same `nullif('')` / `NaN→NULL`
  normalisation the join uses, so a third-party (pandas/pyarrow) key that is `""`
  beside `NULL`, or `NaN` beside `NULL`, can no longer pass an `m:1`/`1:1` check
  and then over-match cartesian-style.
- **`merge, keep()` is a set** (MERGE-2): the mask is built from idempotent
  flags, so `keep(master master)` returns master rows (it had summed bits and
  flipped to using-only).
- **`reshape long` errors on a bare column named like a stub** (RESHAPE-5):
  a kept column colliding with a stub or with `j` now stops loudly (Stata rc 110)
  instead of emitting two same-named columns and losing data.
- **In-memory save of an out-of-range `%tc` errors loudly** (TYPE-SAVE-1): the
  `%tc` writer gained the same range guard the `%td`/`%tC`/period writers have, so
  it no longer narrows to `int64`-MIN garbage with rc 0.
- **`parqit save` onto the open view's own source file is refused** (IO-1): an exact
  canonical-path match is rejected (write elsewhere or `parqit collect` first),
  preventing a lazy view from silently truncating the data it still rereads.
- **Long value labels / notes / characteristics survive the read** (META-1): the
  metadata response is now read whole with `fread` and split on the newline,
  instead of `fget`, whose 32768-byte line cap truncated a long hex field (or
  aborted the load with `r(3300)`). A 30000-byte value label and characteristic
  now round-trip exactly. The (binary, `\n`-only) writer is unchanged.
- **Arrow string layout is guarded** (STR-2): the VARCHAR walker now asserts the
  expected 3-buffer `utf8` layout, so a future engine change to large-utf8 /
  string-view fails loudly instead of reading garbage offsets. No effect on the
  pinned DuckDB 1.5.3.

### Added
- **`parqit rename (oldlist) (newlist)`** (RENAME-1): the parenthesised group form
  documented in the README/brief is now accepted alongside `rename old new`,
  renamed pairwise with equal-length validation.
- **`egen name = fcn(expr)` accepts internal commas** (EGEN-1): the option split
  is parenthesis-aware, so `egen m = mean(cond(x>0, y, .)), by(g)` works.
- **Generated `_merge` carries Stata's value labels** (TT-3): `1 "Master only (1)"`,
  `2 "Using only (2)"`, `3 "Matched (3)"`, so `tabulate`/`list` read like native
  `merge`. Numeric `_merge` values are unchanged.

### Performance
- **`gen`/`keep if` with `_n` stay streaming** (PERF-1): the row-context subquery
  now emits `row_number()` only for `_n` and the blocking `count(*) OVER ()` only
  for `_N`. `_n`-only idioms (`gen seq=_n`, `keep if _n<=K`) become a pure
  `STREAMING_WINDOW` instead of buffering the whole input — ~1.85× faster on a
  20M-row probe (0.805s → 0.435s) and out-of-core safe. `_N` and `_n`+`_N` plans
  are unchanged; no result changes.
- **Lazy open no longer forces a row count for metadata probes** (PERF-3):
  `plan_columns` skips `count(*)` when only schema/metadata is needed, so a
  CSV/non-Parquet `parqit use`/using-side open stops doing a full scan (Parquet was
  already footer-cheap and is unaffected).

### Changed
- **Benchmarks carry no private paths** (REL-2b): the seven `benchmarks/*.do`
  files now take the repo root and reference dataset from args → `PARQIT_REPO` /
  `PARQIT_BENCH_REF` env vars → portable defaults, instead of a hard-coded personal
  path. `tests/release_lint.sh` gained a guard that fails on any `/home/…` or
  `/Users/…` absolute path in tracked source/test/benchmark files (historical
  `.md` audit reports exempt).

### Known limitations
- **`string()` small-magnitude band** (STR-2, resolved in `[Unreleased]`;
  assessed, not changed in this 0.1.4 pass): Stata's
  default `%9.0g` is a width-9 *general* format, approximated by `%.7g`; values in
  `[1e-5,1e-4)` print in scientific where Stata prints decimal. A faithful fix
  means reimplementing width-9 formatting across the whole range, which would risk
  regressing the many values that currently match, so it stays a documented
  approximation (ASSUMPTIONS #44) for this no-regression pass.

### Fixed (earlier 2026-06-14 round)
Correctness fixes from the 2026-06-14 adversarial cross-audit (see
`PARQIT_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT_FOR_CODEX_20260614.md`). All are Stata-faithful and
verified against real Stata 19.5 + an independent oracle; the C++ translator
fixes add 94 executed assertions and a new `v27_audit_fixes` verify test.

- **`merge`/`joinby` now match missing/empty/NaN keys across tool encodings**
  (TT-1). Join keys are normalised to Stata's missing equivalence inside the
  comparison (`""` ≡ NULL, NaN ≡ NULL), so an out-of-core join of a third-party
  (e.g. pandas/pyarrow, which encodes a missing float as NaN) file matches the
  same rows as native Stata, `parqit mergein`, and `parqit collect`. Integer keys
  keep their exact type/value.
- **`reshape long` no longer absorbs a variable that merely shares a stub
  prefix** (RESHAPE-1): with a numeric `j`, only numerically-suffixed columns
  are `xij` members, so `income` is carried (not read as `inc`+`ome`), matching
  Stata. An `i()` variable named like a stub prefix is never consumed (RESHAPE-2).
  `reshape wide` rejects j-values that would form illegal Stata names (RESHAPE-3);
  stub metadata is taken from the lowest j-value, not the lexicographically
  smallest suffix (RESHAPE-4).
- **`collapse (count)`/`firstnm`/`lastnm` on string variables treat `""` as
  missing** (COLLAPSE-1/PARITY-1) — `count` returns the nonmissing count and the
  `*nm` selectors skip empty strings, matching Stata.
- **Expression translator** (XLAT-1…9, PARITY-6), all vs real Stata:
  `string()`/`strofreal()` now emit Stata's `%9.0g` text (not raw `CAST`);
  `substr()`/`strpos()` are byte-based (Stata semantics; `usubstr`/`ustrpos`
  stay character-based); `^` is left-associative; `cond()`, `&`/`|`/`!`,
  `mod(x,y≤0)`, `inrange()` with a missing bound, and `==`/`!=` in value
  context under `statamissing` all match Stata's missing handling; `real()`
  maps `'inf'`/`'nan'` to missing; an internal `_n`/`_N` marker can no longer
  be smuggled through a string literal.
- **A finite Parquet `DOUBLE` outside Stata's storable range** (|x| ≥ 8.99e+307)
  now loads as missing **with a loud note**, never a silent wrong value (TYPE-1).
- **The save path bound-checks period/date values** before narrowing to the
  on-disk integer width and errors loudly on overflow, instead of a silent wrap
  (TYPE-2).
- **Partitioned `parqit save` now stages the partition tree before publishing it**
  (ATOM-1). A failed or unverifiable write removes the temporary tree instead of
  leaving a partial final dataset that blocks retry.
- **A UUID column no longer crashes the eager `parqit use`** path — strings are
  sized over their casted projection, so `use` and `use`+`collect` agree (STR-1).
- **An all-null column loads with a note** instead of a silent all-missing
  variable (META-3).
- **Foreign `parqit.*` metadata is hardened**: a value-label value travels
  hex-encoded so a stray `|`/newline cannot corrupt the protocol (INJ-1); a char
  target/name or value-label name that is not a legal Stata identifier is
  skipped with a note instead of aborting the whole load (META-1); non-integer
  value-label keys are skipped (META-4) while `.`/`.a`–`.z` keys still apply.
- **Numeric ↔ SQL text is locale-independent** (LOC-1/2): `collapse`
  percentiles/median, `sample <share>`, the histogram and skewness/kurtosis
  literals use `std::to_chars`/`std::from_chars`, so a comma-decimal OS locale
  can no longer break or mis-round them. A rejected `memory_limit`/`tempdir`
  value is no longer cached for re-apply (LOC-3).
- **`sort`/`gsort` emit explicit `NULLS LAST`** so missing-last ordering is
  Stata-correct independent of DuckDB's default (SORT-1). The strL sidecar
  header widens the observation field to span Stata-MP's full row capacity
  (THREAD-1). Per-cell SPI store failures during `parqit use`/`collect` now abort
  loudly instead of leaving a staged cell at its default value (THREAD-3). m:m
  merge pairs the using side deterministically (TT-2).
- **`parqit describe` also returns `r(n_columns)`** as a pq-compatible alias of
  `r(n_cols)` (PARITY-5).

### Changed (earlier 2026-06-14 round)
- README qualifies the "lossless" round-trip claim (extended-missing *cell
  identity* `.a`–`.z` is, by the v1 contract, not preserved — labels are);
  `ASSUMPTIONS.md` records the new translator/merge/locale decisions and the
  remaining latent items. The release workflow now installs the static
  libstdc++ archive and fails the build if the shipped Linux plugin links
  libstdc++/libgcc_s dynamically (REL-1), and refuses to publish a release whose
  git tag disagrees with the project version (REL-3). `verify_suite/v21`–`v26`
  use the runner-passed paths (no hardcoded machine paths / private data) (REL-2).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Inline performance tips.** When parqit spots a large operation that has a
  faster route, it prints one truthful, English, one-line tip pointing to it —
  e.g. a big `parqit mergein` suggests doing the join out of core in DuckDB and
  collecting only the result; a large `parqit open _data` suggests
  `parqit mergein`/`appendin` for small-lookup joins. Tips fire only above ~1M
  rows (normal use stays quiet); `global PARQIT_NOTIPS 1` mutes them. A new help
  section ({help parqit##perf}) discusses the in-memory ⋈ disk trade-off with
  worked examples. Verify test `v26_perf_tips`.
- **`parqit mergein` / `parqit appendin`** — join the *in-memory* Stata dataset with
  a disk file (Parquet/CSV/.dta/.xlsx) **fast**, when the disk side is the
  smaller (lookup) one. Instead of round-tripping the in-memory data through the
  DuckDB bridge (`parqit open _data`, ~8.8 s for 10M×13), the in-memory master
  stays put: parqit reads only the needed columns of the disk side (projection
  pushdown) into a throwaway frame, then a **native** `merge`/`append` runs.
  Syntax mirrors native merge: `parqit mergein m:1 key using lookup.parquet,
  keepusing(rate) nogenerate`. On 10M ⋈ 500k this is **≈3.4 s vs ≈9.6 s** for the
  bridge path — result byte-identical (verify test `v25_mergein_appendin`,
  checked `cf _all` against a native merge). A failed disk read leaves the
  in-memory data intact. For *big-on-big* prefer the out-of-core `parqit use …;
  parqit merge` path. See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #42.

### Changed
- **Faster `parqit save … , data` and `parqit open _data`** (the in-memory →
  Parquet path). The Stata→DuckDB transfer now fills DuckDB data chunks in
  column-vector batches (2048 rows) and appends them whole, instead of one
  `duckdb_append_*` call per cell. On a 10M×13 in-memory dataset the write
  drops **≈8.8 s → ≈7.4 s**; every type / date / period / missing conversion is
  byte-identical (the roundtrip suite and V03/V05/V06/V15/V19 verify it). The
  remaining cost is the per-cell `SF_vdata`/`SF_sdata` read out of Stata memory
  (~5.5 s/10M), which — unlike the `SF_vstore` *writes* the parallel fill uses —
  is **not safe to call from worker threads**, so it stays single-threaded; a
  future bulk path (Mata `st_data`, which extracts the same columns in ~0.2 s)
  can lift it. See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #42.
- **`parqit use FILE` + `parqit collect` no longer re-scans to size columns**
  when the view is an untouched full-file passthrough. The collect path
  now reuses the same Parquet row-group-statistics sizing the direct
  `parqit use …, clear` path uses (the F2 metadata path), instead of a
  redundant second full scan. On the all-numeric 47.6M×8 reference file
  this closes the gap to the direct read (`use`→`collect` ≈+0.24 s →
  ≈+0.007 s, same-session min-of-6); string-heavy files were already
  scan-bound and are unchanged — the residual sizing scan only ever
  narrows, so no read regresses. Output is byte-identical to the direct
  path (storage type, format, values). See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #38.
- **Parquet → Stata reads now fill in parallel** (`parqit use …, clear`,
  `parqit collect`). The materialiser runs a producer/consumer pipeline: the
  calling thread fetches + Arrow-converts DuckDB chunks while a pool of
  worker threads stores whole chunks into the staged frame through the
  per-cell SPI, overlapping the engine scan with the fill. On the 47.6M×8
  reference file `parqit use` drops **≈2.9 s → ≈1.5 s** (same session, ~49%).
  No feature or precision change — `fill_column` is reused byte-for-byte,
  so every type/missing/Inf/NUL rule is identical to before; only the
  scheduling differs, and reads below 50k rows keep the serial path. The
  technique follows the prior art `stata_parquet_io`, which stores from
  many threads over disjoint rows (the SPI store is reentrant for distinct
  cells). See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #37.

### Added
- **Read non-Parquet inputs.** `parqit use` and the `using` side of
  `parqit merge`/`joinby`/`append` now accept, by file extension:
  - **delimited text** (`.csv`/`.tsv`/`.txt`) — scanned *out of core* with
    DuckDB `read_csv_auto` (schema/delimiter auto-detected), exactly like
    Parquet: the file may exceed memory and only the needed columns/rows are
    touched;
  - **Stata `.dta`** and **Excel `.xls`/`.xlsx`** — not engine-scannable, so
    parqit imports them into a throwaway frame (the working dataset is untouched)
    and snapshots them to a small Parquet *bridge* the engine scans, carrying
    their variable/value labels and formats. Best for a small side (a lookup
    `.dta`, an `.xlsx`); for a large `.dta` master prefer `use` + `parqit open
    _data`. Bridges are swept up at `parqit close _all`.

  This makes the lazy-master idiom span formats: keep a large Parquet/CSV master
  out of Stata, `parqit merge … using lookup.dta`, and `parqit collect` only the
  result. SAS/SPSS remain out of scope. Verify test `v24_multiformat_sources`.
  See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #41.
- **`parqit use … , relaxed`** — read a glob/file-set whose files have
  *different* schemas by union of column names (columns absent from a file
  arrive missing), mirroring pq's `relaxed`. Without it, a schema mismatch
  across the matched files stays a loud error (never a silent drop). Compiles
  to DuckDB `read_parquet(…, union_by_name = true)`; the F2 metadata-sizing
  fast path still holds (a column present in only some files falls back to a
  scan). Verify test `v23_relaxed_union_by_name`. See `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #40.
- `PARQIT_FILL_THREADS` environment override for the fill worker count:
  `0`/`1` forces the serial path; `n>1` forces that many workers
  (default `min(cores, 8)`). An escape hatch and a tuning knob for
  atypical very wide / string-heavy reads. Read from the OS environment
  (`getenv`) — set it in the shell before launching Stata, not as a Stata
  `global` — and now documented in the help Performance tips and the README.
- Verify test `v20_parallel_fill` — a 1.5M-row parallel read checked
  cell-for-cell (positions, aggregates, Inf/null tallies) against an
  independent pyarrow oracle.
- Verify test `v21_collect_passthrough_sizing` — `parqit use` vs
  `parqit use`+`parqit collect` must be byte-identical (storage type, format,
  value signature) across all-numeric, int/double/string/DATE,
  uint32/decimal/dup-name files and a multi-file glob.
- Verify test `v22_collect_date_no_overflow` — a Parquet DATE column
  spanning 1900–2099 collects to `long` with the exact day-count on both
  paths (independent oracle), guarding the date-aware storage floor.

### Fixed
- **A Parquet DATE column could collect as Stata `int` and overflow** for
  dates past ~2049. `parqit use` already stored such columns as `long`; the
  `parqit collect` path range-refined the cast day-count down to `int`. The
  collect overlay now restores the date-aware `long` floor for `%td`
  columns with no recorded Stata type, matching `parqit use` exactly
  (parqit-written files were already governed by their stored type). Found
  while verifying the passthrough-sizing change above. See
  `ASSUMPTIONS.md` #39.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-12

Broad-spectrum adversarial testing round (joins on missing keys, IEEE
specials, hostile names/payloads, locale, 2500-var width, strL
boundaries) — new suites `v14`–`v19` in `tests/verify_suite/`.

### Fixed
- **float32 values beyond Stata's float range** (±1.70e38 < |v| ≤ ±3.40e38)
  silently became missing: the observed-range pass now widens such
  columns to `double` with a note (finite-only range via `isfinite`).
- **±Inf → missing was silent**: the load now prints a per-column count
  ("Stata has no infinity"). NaN stays a silent NA by convention — it is
  how parquet writers encode float NA.
- **Embedded NUL bytes truncated str# values silently** (the SPI is
  C-string): truncation is now counted and reported per column.

### Added
- `examples/parqit_tour.do` finds the repo-local `ado/plus/p` tree by
  itself when parqit is not yet on the adopath (no arguments needed).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-12

Fixes for the findings of an independent adversarial audit
(`PARQIT_AUDIT_REPORT.md`); regression suite in
`tests/integration/t10_audit_fixes.do`.

### Fixed
- **PARQIT-01 (S0):** `parqit open _data` wrote every promotion to one shared
  bridge file, so a later `open _data, name()` silently rebound earlier
  named views to the newest dataset. Each promotion now snapshots to a
  unique file owned by its view; the plugin erases it when the view is
  closed or replaced.
- **PARQIT-02 (S0):** `parqit reshape long` accepted duplicate `i()` rows that
  native Stata rejects, fabricating long data. It now enforces Stata's
  uniqueness contract eagerly (same pattern `wide` already used for
  `(i,j)`).
- **PARQIT-03 (S2):** `parqit misstable` returned a 0/1 flag in
  `r(n_complete)`; it now returns the true complete-observation count
  (row-wise non-missing across the selected variables) and prints it.
- **PARQIT-04 (S2):** `parqit tabulate a b, row col` accepted but ignored the
  options; row/column percentage panels are now printed.
- **PARQIT-06 (S3):** `stata_call` gained a catch-all exception boundary —
  no C++ exception can cross the `extern "C"` SPI boundary and kill Stata;
  `selftest throw` fault-injects to prove it.
- **PARQIT-07 (S4):** README said `collect` consumes the view; aligned with
  the actual (and documented-in-help) semantics: the view stays open.

### Added
- **`parqit save …, chunk(#)`** (PARQIT-05): the documented option now exists —
  target rows per Parquet row group via the engine's `ROW_GROUP_SIZE`
  (rounded by DuckDB to 2048-row vector multiples).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-12

First working release: the complete public surface of the design README,
green on the full correctness suite (553 C++ assertions executed against
the embedded engine; 17 Stata batch suites on StataNow 19.5 MP with
pyarrow/duckdb as independent oracles, covering every applicable invariant
of the pq 3.0 audit charter).

### Added
- **Self-verifying tour** (`examples/parqit_tour.do` +
  `examples/make_data.py`): eleven sections exercising every feature over
  small artificial datasets (incl. a hostile-schema file), with native
  Stata as the oracle for each lazy result; runs in installed or
  development mode. `parqit egen` now accepts a storage-type prefix
  (`parqit egen double x = …`), carried as the collect-time type like gen.
- **Extended exploration kit** (all push-down; views never mutated,
  memory never touched): `parqit count if <exp>` (filtered count without
  touching the pipeline); `parqit list [varlist] [if] [in f/l]`
  (non-mutating preview with Stata's slice-then-filter semantics);
  `parqit ds` and `parqit lookfor` (names/labels); `parqit codebook`
  (kind/obs/missing/distinct/min/max/label per variable, one scan);
  `parqit distinct [, joint]`; `parqit duplicates report|list`;
  `parqit misstable patterns`; `parqit tabulate` gains native-style missing
  exclusion plus `missing`, `row`, `col`; `parqit tabstat varlist,
  statistics(…) by(…)` (n mean sd var sum min max range median p##);
  `parqit correlate` (listwise) and `parqit pwcorr [, obs sig]` (pairwise,
  exact t-based p-values); `parqit histogram [, bins() nodraw]` — bins
  computed by the engine, only the bin table reaches Stata, drawn with
  twoway bar.
- **Exploration kit on lazy views** (all push-down; nothing materialised,
  memory untouched): `parqit summarize, detail` (variance, skewness,
  kurtosis and p1–p99 with Stata's exact moment and percentile
  definitions — verified against native `summarize, detail` r() to
  1e-10), two-way `parqit tabulate a b` (cross-tab with totals, ≤30
  columns), `parqit misstable [varlist]` (missing count/share per variable;
  strings count ""), and `parqit levelsof var [, limit()]`
  (`r(levels)` with levelsof-style quoting).
- **Views as using sides**: `parqit merge`/`joinby`/`append` accept
  `view:<name>` wherever a using file is expected — the other view's
  pipeline embeds as a subquery, so filtered-view-to-filtered-view joins
  run as one out-of-core query with nothing materialised. Uniqueness
  contracts and pending-range validation apply to view sources; a view
  can be merged with itself; `append` mixes files and views freely.
- **Named views** (frames-like vocabulary): `parqit use using <files>,
  name(qp)` opens/replaces a named lazy view and makes it current (also
  `name()` on `parqit sql` and `parqit open _data`); `parqit view <name>`
  switches, `parqit view <name>: <command>` runs a one-off against another
  view and restores the current one, `parqit views` lists open views,
  `parqit close [<name>|_all]` closes. Verbs always operate on the current
  view; plain `parqit use <file>, clear` reads never touch views.
- M4 power features: `parqit reshape long|wide` (long keeps missing cells
  like Stata via per-j UNION; wide enforces Stata's contracts — (i,j)
  uniqueness, no stray variables — and scans j values up front);
  `parqit sql "…"` opens a view over any DuckDB query (boundary-cast like a
  file source; `, clear` collects immediately); `parqit query "…"` injects a
  raw fragment (e.g. QUALIFY) with fail-fast validation; `parqit summarize`
  and `parqit tabulate` pushdown summaries with `r()` results; `parqit path`;
  the full SMCL help file (`parqit.sthlp`).
- M3 two-table verbs, all lazy with the using side on disk: `parqit merge
  1:1|m:1|1:m|m:m <keys> using <file>` with a Stata-compatible `_merge`
  (missing keys match missing keys via IS NOT DISTINCT FROM), uniqueness
  contracts validated loudly up front, `keep()`, `keepusing()`, `gen()`,
  `nogenerate`, master-wins column collisions (warned), value-label
  definitions carried across; m:m implements Stata's sequential pairing
  exactly (spine + clamped row lookups). `parqit append using <files>`
  (several files, UNION ALL BY NAME, missing columns null, loud
  string/numeric conflicts, `generate()` source marker). `parqit joinby
  <keys> using <file>` (within-key cartesian).
- M2 lazy view + single-table verbs: `parqit use using <files>` now opens a
  lazy view (nothing read; `, clear` still materialises immediately);
  verbs `keep`/`drop` (varlists with wildcards, `if` expressions, `in`
  ranges), `gen` (with storage-type request and `if` qualifier),
  `replace`, `rename`, `order`, `sort`/`gsort`, `collapse` (mean sum sd
  count min max median pNN first last firstnm lastnm — percentiles follow
  Stata's exact rule), `contract`, `duplicates drop`, `sample`
  (reservoir, `count`, `seed()`), `egen` (total mean sd min max count,
  `by()`); materialisers `collect` (one spillable execution, atomic
  swap-in), `save` (pipeline → Parquet, Stata memory untouched), `count`,
  `head`/`list`, `show` (dbplyr-style CTE pipeline), `explain`,
  `describe` (view form); `parqit open _data`; `parqit close`; `parqit set
  statamissing|threads|memory_limit|tempdir`.
- Stata-expression → SQL translator (C++, exhaustively unit-tested by
  executing translated SQL against the engine): operators with Stata
  precedence, missing-literal rewrites (`x < .` et al.), `statamissing`
  mode emulating "missing sorts high", strings-as-"" semantics, 40+
  functions incl. byte-correct strlen, Stata-exact mod/round/cond/
  inrange/inlist, and td()/tm()/tq()/th()/tw()/ty()/tc() literals; _n/_N
  as windows over the declared sort. Dates are day counts and datetimes
  millisecond counts inside pipelines (Stata semantics), converted only
  at the Parquet boundary.
- M1 plain I/O: `parqit use` (whole file, glob or hive directory; optional
  varlist = named columns in named order), `parqit save` (in-memory dataset →
  Parquet with `replace`, `compression()`, `compression_level()`,
  `partition_by()`), `parqit describe` (schema, rows, row groups, files,
  `r()` scalars). Full §4 type map with observed-range integer/string
  sizing; `%td`→DATE, `%tc`→TIMESTAMP, `%tm/%tq/%th/%tw/%ty/%tb` stay
  INTEGER and `%tC` BIGINT period counts; DECIMAL→double; UINT32 via
  BIGINT (never overflow-nulls); TIME→ms-since-midnight; LIST/STRUCT et
  al. dropped loudly. Stata metadata (variable/value labels incl. extended
  missings, notes, chars, formats, data label, original column names)
  round-trips via `parqit.*` Parquet KV metadata. Atomic loads (tempframe →
  validated swap), loud rc on every failure path, written files verified
  by a fresh scan before success is reported.
- Verify suite (ported from the pq 3.0 audit, with pyarrow oracles):
  renamed/awkward column names carry data, period dates never mis-scaled,
  uint32/uint64 overflow, save errors loud, atomic clear, duplicate
  columns disambiguated, unsupported types loud; plus full-type roundtrip
  and shape/option integration tests.
- M0 skeleton: repository layout, CMake build (DuckDB 1.5.3 built from
  source at a SHA256-pinned tag with parquet + core_functions statically
  linked, Stata Plugin Interface 3.0, Arrow C Data Interface header,
  nlohmann/json), cross-platform CI, `parqit` ado dispatcher, and a plugin
  that loads in Stata and reports engine/plugin versions (`parqit version`,
  `parqit selftest`).

### Changed
- **`parqit collect` no longer consumes the view** (dbplyr semantics): the
  pipeline stays open for further exploration or re-collection. The
  silent-stale-save hazard that motivated consumption is now handled by
  explicitness: with a view open, `parqit save` materialises the current
  view and names it in its output, and the new `data` option exports the
  in-memory dataset instead.

### Fixed
- Plugin resolution from an installed PLUS directory: `findfile` returns
  sysdir paths like `~/ado/plus/p/parqit.plugin`, which Stata's plugin
  loader hands raw to dlopen (no tilde expansion → rc 601). The ado now
  expands a leading `~/` via `$HOME` before loading. Found by the
  first clean-environment install check; every test had masked it by
  using an absolute `$PARQIT_PLUGIN_PATH`.
